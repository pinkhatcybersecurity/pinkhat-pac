          It's really important to get information about IP traffic in VPC.
          If there is no enough logging information then it's impossible to track system communication
          and spot if there is something wrong. It is really important in case of security incident.
          Flowlogs captures IP traffic for a specific VPC. Logs can be sent to S3, CloudWatch or Amazon Kinesis
        remediation: >
          Consider adding Flowlogs to VPC:

          resource "aws_vpc" "flowlogs_enabled" {
            cidr_block = "127.0.0.1/16"
          }

          resource "aws_flow_log" "flowlog_exist" {
            traffic_type    = "ALL"
            vpc_id          = aws_vpc.flowlogs_enabled.id
          }
        statement: >
          bool(
            this.parent |
            selectattr('name', 'startswith', 'aws_flow_log') |
            first
          ) if this.parent else false
